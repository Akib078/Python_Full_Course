# Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space
requirements for your program grow as input size grows.

# Big O refers to very large value of n. So the rules -
 i. Keep fastest growing term
 ii. Drop constants

exp : 5*n2 + 3*n + 20
- Keep fastest term or big term
so, 5*n2
- Drop constants
so, Time complexcity is n2 or O(n2)
